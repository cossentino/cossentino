### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ian Cossentino and I'm a full-stack software engineer, primarily coding in Python, ReactJS, and Ruby. I'm currently looking for a full-time position to start my career as a developer.

I discovered my love for coding while working as a clinical researcher, collaborating with machine learning experts on research studying software that predicts patient outcomes. In the following months, I quickly came to see how software engineering's mix of logic puzzles, opportunities for creativity, and never-ending challenges are a perfect fit for my interests.


One of the most compelling uses for the web is to organize and share information to increase the efficiency of our work and home life. Here on my GitHub, you can find some of my projects that do just that:<br>

A Django-JavaScript [web app](https://github.com/cossentino/daily_circ) that adds some serendipity to the news you read<br>
A ReactJS-TailwindCSS [data-visualization tool](https://github.com/cossentino/covid_frontend_react) displaying real-time updating trends in COVID-19 data across the US<br>
A Rails-ERB CRUD budgeting app that keeps track of your monthly expenses<br>


You can find my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cossentino/). And my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11neo-Lh-Gz3E5xnl7OgEV5-48amDo9d9/view?usp=sharing).
